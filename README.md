# GitHubStars

A demo app created for the [WatchKit Workshop](https://corporate.tuenti.com/es/dev/blog/Creating-Apple-Watch-Apps-App-Glance-and-Notifications) heald at Tuenti HQ in 2015.

The app allows you to track your GitHub repositories, and see how many stars, forks, and issues you have. 

It was created to demonstrate how to build Apple Watch apps, but we also used it to play with concepts we were considering to implement in our company by that time:

- MVVM as the main architectural pattern.
- An implementation of a Clean Architecture.
- ReactiveCocoa.
